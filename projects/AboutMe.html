    Hi! My name is Shirley Lim and I'm about to graduate in June 2012 from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).
    This website came into formation as I prepare an interactive portfolio/ resume for my upcoming job searching. I hope
    this provides another perspective to my background, work ethics and what I enjoy during my leisure time.
    
    Majors: Psychology B.A.
            Linguistics (Specialization in Language & Cognition) B.A
    Minor:  Chinese Studies
